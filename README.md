# Getting Started 

These are a set of instructions to follow for you to setup the project locally and run it.

# Step 1: Fork the project repository

Fork the repository to you GitHub .

![fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95677816/193490194-a99edc82-c7a8-4104-8108-69074f676859.png)


# Step 2: Clone your fork

Click on the code drop down menu. Now you can either download the zip file and extract it on your local system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iiitl/geet-hub-community
```

# Step 3: Navigate to your local folder

Since the clone was downloaded into a subdirectory of your working directory, you can navigate to it using: cd NAME_OF_REPOSITORY.

```bash
cd geet-hub-community
```

# step 4 : Install NPM packages

Before running npm you should have node Js installed on your system [node install instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

```bash
npm install
```

# Step 5: Usage

```bash
npm start
```

# Step 6: Create a new branch

Use git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME to create a new branch and then immediately switch to it.

```bash
git checkout -b branch_name
```

Use git branch to show your local branches.
  
```bash
git branch
```

# Step 5: Make changes in your local repository

Use a text editor or IDE to make the changes you planned to the files in your local repository. Because you checked out a branch in the previous step, any edits you make will only affect that branch.

# Step 6: Git Add and Commit your changes

Use git add -A or git add . to stage your changes and `git commit -m "DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES"` to commit them.
  
 ```bash
git add .
git commit -m"<Description of changes>"
```

# Step 7: Push your changes to your fork

When you are done making all of your changes, upload these changes to your fork using git push origin BRANCH_NAME.

  ```bash
git push origin <BRANCH_NAME>
```

# Step 9: Begin the pull request

Return to your fork on GitHub, and refresh the page. You may see a highlighted area that displays your recently pushed branch.
